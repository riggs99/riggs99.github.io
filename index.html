  <h1>Privacy Policy – TerpAI</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>TerpAI (“we,” “us,” or “our”), published by <strong>Cunning Creek Studios</strong>, values your privacy. This application is primarily front‑end and does not collect, store, or transmit personal or sensitive user data, except where required by Google Play’s platform services or third‑party services for premium features or advertising.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>By default, TerpAI does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal or non‑personal information itself. All core functionality operates entirely on your device with no tracking or analytics by us.</p>
  <p>Data may be processed in the following cases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services:</strong> For app distribution, crash reporting, and purchase verification.</li>
    <li><strong>Premium Features:</strong> Purchases are processed securely through Google Play Billing. We do not have direct access to your payment information.</li>
    <li><strong>Footer Advertisement:</strong> If the displayed advertisement is served by a third‑party ad network, it may collect device or usage data as per their own privacy policy. If the ad is static content, no data is collected.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Any data collected by Google Play or third‑party providers is used solely for delivering services such as premium access or ads. TerpAI does not sell or share this data.</p>

  <h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play:</strong> For billing, licensing, and crash/error reporting.</li>
    <li><strong>Ad Provider:</strong> If ads are served dynamically, user or device data may be processed in accordance with the provider’s privacy policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>If you have concerns about data processed by Google Play or the ad provider, please refer to their privacy policies and contact them directly. You may also contact us for assistance.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>TerpAI stores settings and data locally on your device wherever possible. Premium transactions are processed via Google Play’s secure billing system. If third‑party ads are used, they are delivered via secure channels provided by the ad network.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy to meet platform or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted here.</p>
