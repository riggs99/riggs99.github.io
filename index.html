  <h1>Privacy Policy – TerpAI</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>TerpAI (“we,” “us,” or “our”), published by <strong>Cunning Creek Studios</strong>, values your privacy. This application is entirely front‑end and does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data, except in situations required by Google Play services or premium feature activation.</p>

  <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
  <p>By default, TerpAI does <strong>not</strong> collect any personal or non‑personal information. All features and functionality operate entirely on your device. No analytics, tracking, or external data storage is used by us.</p>
  <p>The only information processed may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data automatically collected by Google Play as part of app distribution and billing (covered by Google’s privacy policy).</li>
    <li>Data required if you purchase or activate premium features (such as subscription processing through Google Play Billing).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
  <p>Any data handled by Google Play is used solely for platform services such as purchase verification and is not accessible to us beyond what is needed to deliver premium features you have purchased.</p>

  <h2>4. Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>We do not integrate any analytics, advertising networks, or unrelated third‑party data processors. The only third party involved in data handling is Google Play for standard app store services and premium feature management.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You have the right to contact us regarding any privacy concerns. As we do not store any personal information ourselves, requests for deletion or access should be directed to Google for any platform data they hold.</p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>
  <p>Because TerpAI stores all settings and information locally on your device and never transmits it to our servers, the risk of unauthorised access is minimal. Premium transactions are processed securely through Google Play’s billing system.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to comply with platform requirements or clarify information. Any updates will be published on this page.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact & Developer Information</h2>
