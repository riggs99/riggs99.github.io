3. Data Usage
Any information managed by TerpAI (searches, preferences, age verification, premium status) is used solely for app functionality and stored locally on your device.

No personal data is sold, shared, or transmitted.

No in-app analytics or tracking of personally identifiable information is performed.

For premium features or app delivery, only anonymized or non-personal data may be processed as required by Google Play or service providers.

We do not use third-party analytics for user tracking.

All app data is stored only on your device.

Data is deleted when you uninstall the app or clear the app’s data through your device settings.

You may clear all app data at any time via in-app settings.

Age verification (21+) is required for cannabis-related content.

Age verification status is stored locally and never transmitted.

7. Your Rights
You have full control over your locally stored app data.

You can clear or reset the app at any time.

As no personal information is collected, there is no data to access, export, or object to.
